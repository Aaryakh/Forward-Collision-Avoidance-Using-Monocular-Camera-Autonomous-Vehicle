# Forward-Collision-Avoidance-Using-Monocular-Camera-Autonomous-Vehicle
### This study of a monocular camera-based forward collision warning system is presented in this report. The system is designed to detect and alert the driver of an impending collision within a certain range. The technology makes use of a front-mounted camera to detect objects on the road ahead. The camera captures images of the environment and uses image processing techniques to detect the objects. The system is then able to calculate the distance to the object and alert the driver if a collision is imminent. The system is tested in various simulated scenarios and results are presented. The results show that the system can detect objects at ranges up to 10 m and can accurately alert the driver of an impending collision. The system is also shown to be robust to varying lighting conditions and objects of different shapes and sizes. The results demonstrate that the system can be used to provide the driver with an early warning of an impending collision.
